        <header><h2>About Dungeons & Dragons</h2></header>
        <p><span class="italic">Dungeons & Dragons</span> (commonly abbreviated as <span class="italic">D&D</span> or <span class="italic">DnD</span>) is a fantasy tabletop role-playing game (RPG) originally designed by Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson. It was first published in 1974 by Tactical Studies Rules, Inc. (TSR). The game has been published by Wizards of the Coast (now a subsidiary of Hasbro) since 1997. It was derived from miniature wargames, with a variation of the 1971 game Chainmail serving as the initial rule system. <span class="italic">D&D's</span> publication is commonly recognized as the beginning of modern role-playing games and the role-playing game industry.</p>

        <p><span class="italic">D&D</span> departs from traditional wargaming by allowing each player to create their own character to play instead of a military formation. These characters embark upon imaginary adventures within a fantasy setting. A Dungeon Master (DM) serves as the game's referee and storyteller, while maintaining the setting in which the adventures occur, and playing the role of the inhabitants of the game world. The characters form a party and they interact with the setting's inhabitants and each other. Together they solve dilemmas, engage in battles, explore, and gather treasure and knowledge. In the process, the characters earn experience points (XP) in order to rise in levels, and become increasingly powerful over a series of separate gaming sessions.</p>

        <p>The early success of <span class="italic">D&D</span> led to a proliferation of similar game systems. Despite the competition, <span class="italic">D&D</span> has remained as the market leader in the role-playing game industry. In 1977, the game was split into two branches:</p> 
          
        <ul>
          <li>the relatively rules-light game system of basic <span class="italic">Dungeons & Dragons</span></li>
          <li>and the more structured, rules-heavy game system of <span class="italic">Advanced Dungeons & Dragons</span> (abbreviated as <span class="italic">AD&D</span>).</li>
        </ul>

        <p><span class="italic">AD&D</span> 2nd Edition was published in 1989. In 2000, a new system was released as <span class="italic">D&D</span> 3rd edition, continuing the edition numbering from <span class="italic">AD&D</span>; a revised version 3.5 was released in June 2003. These 3rd edition rules formed the basis of the d20 System, which is available under the Open Game License (OGL) for use by other publishers. <span class="italic">D&D</span> 4th edition was released in June 2008. The 5th edition of <span class="italic">D&D</span>, the most recent, was released during the second half of 2014.</p>

        <p>In 2004, <span class="italic">D&D</span> remained the best-known, and best-selling, role-playing game in the US, with an estimated 20 million people having played the game, and more than US$1 billion in book and equipment sales worldwide. The year 2017 had "the most number of players in its history—12 million to 15 million in North America alone". <span class="italic">D&D</span> 5th edition sales "were up 41 percent in 2017 from the year before, and soared another 52 percent in 2018, the game's biggest sales year yet". The game has been supplemented by many pre-made adventures, as well as commercial campaign settings suitable for use by regular gaming groups. <span class="italic">D&D</span> is known beyond the game itself for other <span class="italic">D&D</span>-branded products, references in popular culture, and some of the controversies that have surrounded it, particularly a moral panic in the 1980s falsely linking it to Satanism and suicide. The game has won multiple awards and has been translated into many languages.</p>

        <header><h2>Play Overview</h2></header>
        <p><span class="italic">Dungeons & Dragons</span> is a structured yet open-ended role-playing game. It is normally played indoors with the participants seated around a tabletop. Typically, each player controls only a single character, which represents an individual in a fictional setting. When working together as a group, these player characters (PCs) are often described as a "party" of adventurers, with each member often having their own area of specialty which contributes to the success of the whole. During the course of play, each player directs the actions of their character and their interactions with other characters in the game. This activity is performed through the verbal impersonation of the characters by the players, while employing a variety of social and other useful cognitive skills, such as logic, basic mathematics and imagination. A game often continues over a series of meetings to complete a single adventure, and longer into a series of related gaming adventures, called a "campaign".</p>
        
        <p>The results of the party's choices and the overall storyline for the game are determined by the Dungeon Master (DM) according to the rules of the game and the DM's interpretation of those rules. The DM selects and describes the various non-player characters (NPCs) that the party encounters, the settings in which these interactions occur, and the outcomes of those encounters based on the players' choices and actions. Encounters often take the form of battles with "monsters" – a generic term used in <span class="italic">D&D</span> to describe potentially hostile beings such as animals, aberrant beings, or mythical creatures. The game's extensive rules – which cover diverse subjects such as social interactions, magic use, combat, and the effect of the environment on PCs – help the DM to make these decisions. The DM may choose to deviate from the published rules or make up new ones if they feel it is necessary.</p>
        
        <p>The most recent versions of the game's rules are detailed in three core rulebooks:</p> 
          
        <ul>
            <li><span class="italic-bold">The Player's Handbook</span></li>
            <li><span class="italic-bold">The Dungeon Master's Guide</span></li>
            <li><span class="italic-bold">and The Monster Manual</span>.</li>
          </ul>
        
        <p>The only items required to play the game are the rulebooks, a character sheet for each player, and a number of polyhedral dice. Many players also use miniature figures on a grid map as a visual aid, particularly during combat. Some editions of the game presume such usage. Many optional accessories are available to enhance the game, such as expansion rulebooks, pre-designed adventures and various campaign settings.</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Game_Mechanics">
        <header><h2>Game Mechanics</h2></header>
        <p>Before the game begins, each player creates their player character and records the details (described below) on a character sheet. First, a player determines their character's ability scores, which consist of</p>
          
        <ul>
          <li>Strength</li>
          <li>Constitution</li>
          <li>Dexterity</li>
          <li>Intelligence</li>
          <li>Wisdom</li>
          <li>and Charisma.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Each edition of the game has offered differing methods of determining these statistics. The player then chooses a race (species) such as human or elf, a character class (occupation) such as fighter or wizard, an alignment (a moral and ethical outlook), and other features to round out the character's abilities and backstory, which have varied in nature through differing editions.</p>

        <p>During the game, players describe their PCs' intended actions, such as punching an opponent or picking a lock, and converse with the DM, who then describes the result or response. Trivial actions, such as picking up a letter or opening an unlocked door, are usually automatically successful. The outcomes of more complex or risky actions are determined by rolling dice. Different polyhedral dice are used for different actions, such as a twenty-sided die to see whether a hit was made in combat, but an eight-sided die to determine how much damage was dealt. Factors contributing to the outcome include the character's ability scores, skills and the difficulty of the task. In circumstances where a character does not have control of an event, such as when a trap or magical effect is triggered or a spell is cast, a saving throw can be used to determine whether the resulting damage is reduced or avoided. In this case the odds of success are influenced by the character's class, levels and ability scores.</p>
        
        <p>As the game is played, each PC changes over time and generally increases in capability. Characters gain (or sometimes lose) experience, skills and wealth, and may even alter their alignment or gain additional character classes. The key way characters progress is by earning experience points (XP), which happens when they defeat an enemy or accomplish a difficult task. Acquiring enough XP allows a PC to advance a level, which grants the character improved class features, abilities and skills. XP can be lost in some circumstances, such as encounters with creatures that drain life energy, or by use of certain magical powers that come with an XP cost.</p>
        
        <p>Hit points (HP) are a measure of a character's vitality and health and are determined by the class, level and constitution of each character. They can be temporarily lost when a character sustains wounds in combat or otherwise comes to harm, and loss of HP is the most common way for a character to die in the game. Death can also result from the loss of key ability scores or character levels. When a PC dies, it is often possible for the dead character to be resurrected through magic, although some penalties may be imposed as a result. If resurrection is not possible or not desired, the player may instead create a new PC to resume playing the game.</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Adventures_and_Campaigns">
        <header><h2>Adventures and Campaigns</h2></header>
        <p>A typical <span class="italic">Dungeons & Dragons</span> game consists of an "adventure", which is roughly equivalent to a single story. The DM can either design an original adventure, or follow one of the many pre-made adventures (also known as "modules") that have been published throughout the history of <span class="italic">Dungeons & Dragons</span>. Published adventures typically include a background story, illustrations, maps and goals for PCs to achieve. Some include location descriptions and handouts. Although a small adventure entitled "Temple of the Frog" was included in the Blackmoor rules supplement in 1975, the first stand-alone <span class="italic">D&D</span> module published by TSR was 1978's Steading of the Hill Giant Chief, written by Gygax.</p>

        <p>A linked series of adventures is commonly referred to as a "campaign". The locations where these adventures occur, such as a city, country, planet or an entire fictional universe, are referred to as "campaign settings" or "world". <span class="italic">D&D</span> settings are based in various fantasy genres and feature different levels and types of magic and technology. Popular commercially published campaign settings for <span class="italic">Dungeons & Dragons</span> include</p> 
          
        <ul>
          <li>Greyhawk</li>
          <li>Dragonlance</li>
          <li>Forgotten Realms</li>
          <li>Mystara</li>
          <li>Spelljammer</li>
          <li>Ravenloft</li>
          <li>Dark Sun</li>
          <li>Planescape</li>
          <li>Birthright</li>
          <li>and Eberron.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>In addition to first-party campaigns and modules, two campaigns based on popular culture have been created. The first, based on <span class="italic-bold">Stranger Things</span>, was released in May 2019. A campaign based on the <span class="italic-bold">Rick and Morty vs. Dungeons and Dragons</span> comic book series was later released in November 2019.</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Miniature_Figures">
        <header><h2>Miniature Figures</h2></header>
        <p>The wargames from which <span class="italic">Dungeons & Dragons</span> evolved used miniature figures to represent combatants. <span class="italic">D&D</span> initially continued the use of miniatures in a fashion similar to its direct precursors. The original <span class="italic">D&D </span>set of 1974 required the use of the Chainmail miniatures game for combat resolution. By the publication of the 1977 game editions, combat was mostly resolved verbally. Thus miniatures were no longer required for game play, although some players continued to use them as a visual reference.</p>

        <p>In the 1970s, numerous companies began to sell miniature figures specifically for <span class="italic">Dungeons & Dragons</span> and similar games. Licensed miniature manufacturers who produced official figures include</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>Grenadier Miniatures (1980–1983)</li>
          <li>Citadel Miniatures (1984–1986)</li>
          <li>Ral Partha</li>
          <li>and TSR itself.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Most of these miniatures used the 25 mm scale.</p>

        <p>Periodically, <span class="italic">Dungeons & Dragons</span> has returned to its wargaming roots with supplementary rules systems for miniatures-based wargaming. Supplements such as Battlesystem (1985 and 1989) and a new edition of Chainmail (2001) provided rule systems to handle battles between armies by using miniatures.</p>
